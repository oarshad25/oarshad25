<p>
Welcome! I am a computational biologist applying statistical and bioinformatic approaches to analyse, model and interpret high-throughput
biological data. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in Computational Genomics in the
<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/hurles-group/" target="blank">Hurles group</a>
at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England.

<p>
I completed my PhD in genomic signal processing at the
<a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html" target="blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University</a>
in 2017. Prior to joining Sanger, I was a postdoctoral fellow in computational cancer biology at The U.S. Department of Energy's
<a href="https://www.pnnl.gov" target="blank">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>.
