# Research

My research spans computational functional genomics, integrative analysis of multiomic datasets and modelling and
inference of gene regulatory networks. Some representative projects are outlined below:

* In one [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100004), I carried out comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic,
  proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis from a large prospectively collected cohort of clinical samples from
  high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) of the ovary identifying pathways that significantly differentiate between HGSC and
  relevant normal fallopian tube samples. This analysis revealed proliferation induced replication stress and homologous
  repair deficiency to be drivers of genomic instability in ovarian cancer and was the first deep proteomic comparison
  of fallopian tube tissue and ovarian cancer tissue.

* In another [paper](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA119.001540), I have investigated the relationships of kinase levels
  and activity in cancer by comprehensive simultaneous analysis of proteins and phosphorylated proteins from over 150
  tumours in order to characterise the landscape of kinase-substrate phosphorylation interactions.

* A third [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12726) was one of the first to offer insights as to why night work elevates
  the risk of cancer. Statistical analyses that I did for this paper indicated that a night shift schedule causes
  circadian dysregulation of genetic mechanisms of DNA repair which may potentiate the elevated cancer risk
  associated with shift work.

* In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1522-2), I developed models for gene regulatory networks for improved
  combinatorial cancer therapy design.
